# Diploma-1day-Workshop
Repository containing all the codes for one-day hands on VLSI workshop for diploma students.

Refer to the folder `source/rtl` folder for all RTL codes. Similarly, the `source/verification` folder captures all the testbenches for the RTL designs.

Verilog language has been used to model all the designs and testbenches (which contain the stimuli to verify if the design functionality is met or not).
